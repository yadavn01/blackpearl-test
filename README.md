I've spent around 3 hours on this project. If given more time I would add several enhancements to this project.

- Firstly, I would add redux for state managment, it would improve the scalability and maintainence of the app. 
- I would also use StyledComponents or MUI for cleaner styling instead of inline styling.
- Integrate API to fetch data and persist user, to give it more real world application experience.
- Implement Authentication to secure application.

Thanks for the opportunity :)
